In this code, we first check if CUDA is available and set the device accordingly. 
Then, we load a pre-trained Faster R-CNN model that is pre-trained on COCO dataset for object detection, specifically for detecting pedestrians.
The video frames are processed in a loop, where each frame is preprocessed and passed through the model for inference.
The predictions are then processed to filter out pedestrian detections with a confidence score above a certain threshold.
Finally, the bounding boxes for pedestrians are drawn on the frame and displayed in a window.
The code utilizes GPU acceleration to leverage the power of the GPU for faster inference
